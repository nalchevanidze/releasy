# Relasy

Relasy is a set of GitHub Actions for **label-driven releases**. It automates the full flow:

- determine the **next version** from PR labels
- generate a **changelog** from merged PRs since the last release
- open a **release PR** containing both the changelog and the version bump commit
- publish a **GitHub Release** when that release PR is merged
- validate and bootstrap PR labels to keep changelogs clean

> **Source of truth:** the **release PR** generated by `draft-release`.

---

## How it works (Draft → Release PR → Publish)

### 1) Draft release (`draft-release` action)

Triggered manually (usually via `workflow_dispatch`).

`draft-release` will:

- collect merged PRs since the last GitHub Release (or tag)
- compute the **next version** using PR labels (semver bump rules)
- update version files (based on your config), and **commit** the version bump
- generate a changelog grouped by **change/type labels**
- open a **release PR** to `main`:
  - **title:** `release-<version>`
  - **body:** generated changelog
  - **commits:** includes the version bump commit generated by the action

✅ You **do not** need to bump versions manually.

> Note: if `draft-release` fails with a **403** while creating the PR, ensure the repo setting
> **“Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests”** is enabled.

### 2) Review the release PR

Before merging, you can optionally edit the PR body to:

- polish wording
- reorder sections
- remove internal notes, etc.
- commit additional changes if needed (manual fixes, etc.)

### 3) Publish release (`publish-release` action)

Triggered when the release PR is merged.

`publish-release` will:

- detect merged PRs where:
  - base branch is `main`
  - head branch starts with `release-`
- use the **merged release PR body** as the release notes
- create/publish the **GitHub Release** (optionally returning an `upload_url` output)

---

## Labels drive versioning & changelogs

Relasy uses PR labels to decide:

- **what bump** a change represents (major/minor/patch)
- **where it appears** in the changelog (Breaking / Features / Fixes / etc.)
- optional **package tags** for monorepos (`📦 <pkgKey>`)

When multiple PRs are included in a release, Relasy applies the **highest bump** needed across them (major > minor > patch).

### Label contract (recommended defaults)

Every PR should have **exactly one** change/type label:

|       Label | Meaning         | Version bump | Changelog section |
| ----------: | --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 💥 breaking | breaking change | major        | Breaking Changes  |
|  ✨ feature | new feature     | minor        | New Features      |
|      🐛 fix | bug fix         | patch        | Bug Fixes         |
|    🧹 chore | maintenance     | patch        | Minor Changes     |

Optional (monorepos): **zero or more** package labels:

- `📦 <pkgKey>` — each `<pkgKey>` must match a key in `relasy.json` → `pkgs`

> If a PR touches multiple packages, add multiple `📦` labels. Relasy will include them as tags on the changelog entry (no package grouping required).

---

## Configuration (`relasy.json`)

Relasy reads configuration from `relasy.json` to adapt to your repo conventions without changing action code.

At a high level, `relasy.json` describes:

- the **pkgs** in your repo (single package or many packages/modules)
- which **tooling** is used to resolve versioning/publishing details (`project`)

### Schema overview

```json
{
  "pkgs": {
    "shortName": "long-package-identifier"
  },
  "project": {
    "type": "npm"
  }
}
```

### `pkgs`

`pkgs` is a mapping of logical **pkg keys** to a **package identifier**.

- For **npm** projects, the value is typically the npm package name (often scoped).
- For **custom** projects, the value is whatever identifier the custom workflow expects.

The `pkgs` keys (`core`, `server`, `client`, etc.) are the handles you reference when you need to act on a specific module/package.

> In monorepos, package labels use the format `📦 <pkgKey>`, where `<pkgKey>` must be a key in `pkgs`.

You can override any subset by providing only those keys.

### `project`

`project` selects the manager used by Relasy.

Supported managers:

- `type: "npm"`
- `type: "custom"`

If `type` is `"custom"`, the following fields are required:

- `pkg` (string): a package reference or URL template (can include `{{PKG}}`)
- `version` (string): command to retrieve the current version
- `bump` (string): command to compute and apply the next version (e.g., `hconf next {{BUMP}}` where `{{BUMP}}` is replaced with `major`, `minor`, or `patch`)
- `postBump` (string): optional command to execute after version bumping, such as updating lockfiles, regenerating build artifacts, or running post-version scripts

## Configuration examples

### npm project (single pkg)

```json
{
  "pkgs": {
    "core": "relasy/core"
  },
  "project": {
    "type": "npm"
  }
}
```

### custom project (multiple pkgs)

```json
{
  "pkgs": {
    "server": "morpheus-graphql",
    "client": "morpheus-graphql-client",
    "core": "morpheus-graphql-core",
  },
  "project": {
    "type": "custom",
    "pkg": "https://hackage.haskell.org/package/{{PKG}}",
    "version": "hconf version",
    "bump": "hconf next {{BUMP}}",
    "postBump": "hconf setup 9.6.3"
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

- In custom mode, `{{PKG}}` is substituted with the resolved pkg identifier
  (e.g. `morpheus-graphql-core`).

---

## Publishing strategies

### `npm` (simple, centralized version)

When `project.type` is `"npm"`:

- versioning is typically **centralized** (e.g. one version source of truth)
- best suited when packages share a version

✅ easiest to operate
⚠️ not suitable if each package needs independent versions

### `custom` (fully flexible)

When `project.type` is `"custom"`:

- use it when you need custom versioning rules or publishing commands

✅ best for complex repos / bespoke pipelines

on: workflow_dispatch

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  draft-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: main
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Draft Release PR (compute version + commit bump + changelog + open PR)
        uses: nalchevanidze/relasy/actions/draft-release@v1.0.0

## Helper Actions (recommended)

Relasy works best when PR labels are consistent. To make that easy, add these optional helper actions to your workflows.

### Validate PR labels (`validate-pr-labels`)

This action enforces the label contract on every PR so releases don’t get blocked or produce messy changelogs.

What it checks (recommended defaults):

- **Exactly one** change/type label (e.g. `💥 breaking`, `✨ feature`, `🐛 fix`, `🧹 chore`)
- **Zero or more** pkg labels for monorepos (e.g. `📦 client`, `📦 server`)
- If any pkg labels are present, each must match a key in `relasy.json` → `pkgs` (prevents typos like `📦 frontend`)

Suggested workflow:

```yaml
name: Validate PR Labels

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      [
        opened,
        reopened,
        labeled,
        unlabeled,
        synchronize,
        edited,
        ready_for_review,
      ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate PR Labels
        uses: nalchevanidze/relasy/actions/validate-pr-labels@v1.0.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

---

### Bootstrap labels (`bootstrap-labels`)

This action creates the labels Relasy expects in a repository (useful for onboarding and keeping label sets consistent).

What it creates (typical):

- Type labels: `💥 breaking`, `✨ feature`, `🐛 fix`, `🧹 chore`
- Pkg labels from `relasy.json`: `📦 <pkgKey>` for each key under `pkgs`

Suggested workflow:

```yaml
name: Bootstrap Labels
on: workflow_dispatch

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write

jobs:
  bootstrap:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create/ensure required labels exist
        uses: nalchevanidze/relasy/actions/bootstrap-labels@v1.0.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
